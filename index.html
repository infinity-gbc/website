         Even after all this time, we still get emails from people wondering what happened
         to the company or if Infinity will ever be released.  Here's the answer: the team
         has been disbanded since 2002, and there is a slim possibility that Infinity may
         one day be released as a ROM file for free on the website.  A ROM file would allow
         the game to be played in emulators or be burned to your own cartridge.<br>
         <br>
         The website continues to exist because our web hosting is essentially free.
         But make no mistake, Affinix as a game company is not operational.  There is no
         planned date for release of a ROM.  Infinity is completely obsolete by today's
         standards and we have no plans to sell it, so there is very little incentive to
         work on the project.  Who knows, though, maybe we'll eventually finish the darn
         thing.<br>
         <br>
         Justin went on to found the <a href="http://psi-im.org/">Psi IM client</a> project, and he continues to use the Affinix name for things (despite them having no relation to gaming).<br>

         Hideaki has moved to Japan and started a family.  He has virtually no Internet presence these days.<br>
         <br>
         Mark went on to law school.<br>

         The status of the others is unknown, but they are probably doing something useful.<br>

         <span id="date">[January 21, 2002]</span><br>
         <br>
         The time spent searching for publishers closed our near shut window of opportunity for
         getting Infinity published.  It seems very clear now that Infinity will not be
         published for GBC.<br>
         <br>
         On the good side of things, Affinix may be involved in an upcoming GBA project with
         <a href="http://www.metro3d.com/">Metro 3D</a>.  Stay tuned!<br>

         <br>
         After months of negotiation, <a href="http://www.cravegames.com/">Crave
         Entertainment</a> has decided not to publish Infinity.  Quality
         design and artistic talent gave way to statistical analysis,
         which revealed that the Game Boy COLOR<sup>TM</sup> is no longer
         a competitive platform for publication compared to the newly
         released Game Boy ADVANCE<sup>TM</sup>.  This means that the
         greatest role-playing game ever created for the Game Boy<sup>TM</sup>
         platform still has no publisher.  We, however, believe that
         Infinity can be competitive in the midst of GBA as explained
         in our <a href="projects.html#faq">FAQ</a>.<br>
         <br>
         We will continue the publisher search, and as always, we will
         update the page when more news is available.<br>

         <span class="h">Infinity makes E3</span>
         <span id="date">[May 16, 2001]</span><br>
         <br>
         At last, all the work we've been doing here at Affinix has paid
         off: Infinity will be shown at the <a href="http://www.e3expo.com/">Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3)</a>
         in <a href="http://www.cravegames.com/">Crave Entertainment's</a>
         booth.  We're very proud to unveil Infinity to the public at last.
         We hope that fans, reporters, and industry analysts will have a
         chance to see Infinity in action and see that a beautiful, epic
         RPG is not impossible on the GBC.  We look forward to releasing
         substantial media updates in the coming days.  Lastly, we'd like
         to thank all our loyal fans who have stuck with us for the two
         years we've been working on Infinity -- or Joltima II, as it was
         once known.  It's been a blast, and the best is just beginning!<br>

         <span class="h">The Infinite Wait for Publication</span>
         <span id="date">[April 23, 2001]</span><br>
         <br>
         Several publishers have reviewed/are reviewing Infinity, and we
         are awaiting their responses.  Meanwhile, the Affinix team has
         decided to make several more fine-tuning revisions.<br>
         <br>
         The next announcement will be made when we make a deal with a publisher.<br>
         <br>
         New <a href="projects.html#ss">screen shots</a> have been posted.<br>
         <br>
         <span class="h">Infinity nears completion</span>
         <span id="date">[December 31, 2000]</span><br>
         <br>
         The price of high aspirations is lengthy revision, which means that though
         we've made tremendous progress with Infinity, we have been unable to meet our
         intended completion date of December 31st.  We are confident, however, that we
         will produce the game in a timely manner, and we are sure that players will
         appreciate the extra time spent in polishing every aspect.<br>
         <br>
