         <span class="h">Q: When is the projected release date for Infinity?</span><br><br>
         A: Currently, Infinity is being reviewed by publishers. Only time
         will tell, when we are able to make a deal with a publisher.
        </p>
        <p><span id="gray">
         <span class="h">Q: How will the game be sold when it is finished?  Will it be sold through
         your website or through retail stores?</span><br><br>
         A: The publisher we make a deal with will take care of the marketing of Infinity,
         and thus, likely will mean sale at retail stores.
        </span></p>
        <p><span id="gray">
         <span class="h">Q: What will be the cost of the game?</span><br><br>
         A: Again, this will be a decision of the publisher.  We estimate that
         the retail cost will be about US$30.
        </span></p>
        <p><span id="gray">
         <span class="h">Q: Do you have a publisher yet?</span><br><br>
         A: No.
        </span></p>
        <p><span id="gray">
         <span class="h">Q: Why not?</span><br><br>
         A: Publishers these days seem to be more interested in the Game Boy
         ADVANCE<sup>TM</sup>.
        </span></p>
        <p><span id="gray">
         <span class="h">Q: Do you plan on making a Game Boy ADVANCE<sup>TM</sup> version of Infinity?</span><br><br>
         A: That would mean remaking the game.  Currently, we believe that
         Infinity is still a viable game even with the presence of the GBA,
         since there are still no role-playing games available on that
         platform.  There is also no RPG of this quality on the Game Boy
         COLOR<sup>TM</sup>

        <p><span id="gray">
         <span class="h">Q: Do you plan on making any other Game Boy ADVANCE<sup>TM</sup> titles?</span><br><br>
         A: Affinix may be involved in an upcoming GBA project with Metro 3D. Stay tuned!
