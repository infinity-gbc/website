         moves forward, taking us like leaves in the wind...<br>
         We meet, we brush against each other, and then fall to the earth...<br>
         Longing for the days when we shared a branch together...<br>
         Longing for the spring...<br>
         But all things end..."</i></center><br><br>
         The events of the past shape those of the present, and the sins of
         our fathers are repaid with our suffering.<br><br>
         So is it that two races have fought a vicious war over a
         centuries-old betrayal. The Aluthans and Selerans, once great
         allies, have now become persecuted and persecutor.  As the Aluthans
         endure the abuses of the conquering Selerans, the Selerans
         themselves are laid low by a life consuming plague.  Awakened by
         the terrible misery of the world, an ancient evil begins to stir.
         Now, a handful of heroes, the only ones to realize the great
         darkness that is gathering, must find a way to save their world
         before it is too late.<br><br>
         Enter the world of Infinity, in which all is not what it seems, and courage may be the only
         weapon strong enough to face the foes that are coming.
